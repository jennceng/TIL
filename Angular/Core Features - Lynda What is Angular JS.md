**Directives **

* begin with ng- such as ‘ng-app’, ‘ng-view'

**Data Binding**

* makes templating possible
* create placeholders for content which is linked to data information
* can link form elements to tie it to data

* for example a search bar can be used to filter / query by tying input to query attribute

**Filter**

* comes with a filtering language that organizes data automatically or easily changed for form elements

**Modules**

* I assume this was extra cool pre-es6

**Routes - heart of SPA**

* divide templates so functionality behind application can exist in different places
* i assume renders template based on url

**Controllers**

* tie everything together
* functionality for each differenet view is controled by controllers
